This Ninject extension enables one to preserve contextual information pertaining to earlier requests that indirectly led to a given request in order to fulfil the following key objectives:
- Enable more detailed tracing of Resolution failures
- Enable richer Contextual Binding (e.g. being able to define rules looking further up the resolution hierarchy such as when a Factory enters the picture, including ones generated by Ninject.Extensions.Factory)
- Enable richer Scoping rules (e.g. being able to use Ninject.Extensions.NamedScope's InCallScope for objects created by a Factory)
